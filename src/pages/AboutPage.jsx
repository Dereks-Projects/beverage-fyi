          <div className="why-content">
            <p className="why-text">
              After two decades in the beverage industry, I've been fortunate to learn from incredible 
              mentors, work alongside talented professionals, and serve guests who genuinely cared about 
              what they were drinking. This industry has given me so muchâ€”knowledge, experiences, and a 
              career I'm grateful for.
            </p>
            <p className="why-text">
              But I kept noticing the same frustrations: professionals spending time hunting for basic 
              information that should be instantly accessible. Students paying for multiple subscriptions 
              just to study. Enthusiasts hitting paywalls when trying to learn more about a wine or spirit 
              they enjoyed.
            </p>
            <p className="why-text">
              I wanted to create something differentâ€”a comprehensive resource that's free, reliable, and 
              organized around how people actually search for information. No gatekeeping. No premium tiers. 
              Just the knowledge that should be accessible to anyone interested in beverages.
            </p>
            <p className="why-text-final">
              This is my way of giving back to a community and industry that's given me a career and 
              countless opportunities to learn and grow.

                I'm Derek Engles, and I've spent the last 20 years working in hospitalityâ€”serving guests, 
                managing beverage programs, and training teams at restaurants, hotels, and Fortune 500 companies. 
                Along the way, I became a certified sommelier and had the privilege of learning from some of 
                the best professionals in the industry.
              </p>
              <p className="creator-bio">
                A few years ago, I started learning to code. Not because I wanted to change careers, but 
                because I wanted to build something useful for the beverage community. Beverage.fyi is the 
                result of that journeyâ€”I designed it, wrote the code, and filled it with insights from my 
                years of professional experience.
              </p>
              <p className="creator-bio">
                I also wrote <em>The Beverage Compass</em>, a comprehensive guidebook covering wine regions, 
                spirit production, cocktail history, and service techniques. The book is available now on 
                Amazon Kindle, and I'm working on integrating its content directly into this platform so 
                everything is in one place.
              </p>
              <p className="creator-bio">
                Building this platform has been a learning experience in itselfâ€”combining what I know about 
                beverages with what I've learned about technology. It's not perfect, but it's built with care, 
                and it gets better as I continue to develop new features and add more content.

                If you have feedback, suggestions, or just want to say hello, I'd love to hear from you. 
                This project exists because of the beverage community, and I want it to serve that community well.
