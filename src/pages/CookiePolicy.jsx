                Some browsers include a "Do Not Track" (DNT) feature that signals to websites that you 
                visit that you do not want to have your online activity tracked. At this time, we do not 
                respond to DNT signals. This is consistent with the current state of technology, as there 
                is no industry standard for how to respond to DNT signals.
