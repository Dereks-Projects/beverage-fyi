  {
    "term": "Tannin",
    "definition": "A chemical compound, naturally occurring in wine, that gives the drinker the impression of astringency. This component is necessary, when in balance with other elements such as alcohol and acidity. With white wine, we want no tannin (or at least little) and with red wine we want the appropriate amount that is typical of that wine from that region."

  {
    "term": "Tartaric acid",
    "definition": "This is a naturally occurring acid found in grapes and the corresponding wine. If you have ever seen some fine sediment in a bottle of white wine (especially if you leave it in an ice bucket too long) it’s tartaric crystals."

    "term": "Tea",
    "definition": "Tea, derived from the leaves of the Camellia sinensis plant, represents the world's second most consumed beverage after water and encompasses six main categories—white, green, oolong, black, dark (pu-erh), and yellow—that are distinguished primarily by their level of oxidation and processing methods rather than different plant varieties. The fundamental difference between tea types lies in how the leaves are treated after harvesting: green teas are quickly heated to prevent oxidation (maintaining their fresh, grassy character), black teas are fully oxidized to develop robust, malty flavors, while oolong teas are partially oxidized to create complex profiles that bridge green and black tea characteristics. Terroir plays a crucial role in tea quality, with factors like altitude, soil composition, climate, and seasonal timing affecting flavor development—high-altitude teas from regions like Darjeeling, Ceylon, and Chinese mountain gardens often produce more complex, nuanced cups due to slower growth and concentrated flavors. Proper brewing technique is essential for quality tea appreciation: different tea types require specific water temperatures (160-185°F for delicate greens, 200-212°F for robust blacks) and steeping times (1-3 minutes for most teas) to extract optimal flavors without bitterness, while factors like tea-to-water ratio and water quality significantly impact the final cup."

    "term": "Tequila",
    "definition": "Tequila is a distinctive Mexican spirit made exclusively from the blue Weber agave plant, primarily in the region surrounding Tequila, Jalisco, and a few designated areas in other Mexican states. To be legally called tequila, it must be produced in Mexico under strict regulation, and must contain at least 51% blue agave, though the best-quality tequilas—labeled 100% agave—are made entirely from the plant’s fermented sugars. After harvest, the agave “piñas” are cooked, crushed to extract juice, fermented, and then distilled, often twice, to create a clear, high-proof spirit. Tequila is categorized by aging: Blanco (unaged), Reposado (aged 2–12 months), Añejo (1–3 years), and Extra Añejo (3+ years), each offering a different expression of agave flavor and wood influence. Valued for its earthy, herbal, and peppery character, tequila is both a foundational cocktail spirit (as in Margaritas and Palomas) and a complex artisanal product appreciated by connoisseurs worldwide."

These beers are most famously produced in Belgium, though select Trappist breweries also exist in the Netherlands, Austria, Italy, England, France, and the USA, each with limited and highly traditional production. Styles vary but often include Dubbel (dark and malty), Tripel (strong and golden), and Quadrupel (rich, boozy, and complex), typically bottle-conditioned and known for their yeasty esters, dark fruit flavors, and elegant structure. Trappist beers are deeply rooted in history, craftsmanship, and spiritual discipline, making them some of the most revered and sought-after beers in the world."
